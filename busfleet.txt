The bus fleet of the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) plays a crucial role in public transportation across Telangana. Established initially as NSRRTD in 1932, TSRTC evolved into a separate entity following the state's bifurcation in 2015. With thousands of buses, TSRTC operates extensive routes, connecting urban and rural areas, ensuring accessibility and mobility for millions of passengers daily. The fleet's efficiency and reliability are vital for the region's economic and social activities. Recent developments include the Telangana government's decision to merge TSRTC with the state administration and rename it to TGSRTC in 2024.
