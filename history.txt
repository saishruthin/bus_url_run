The Road Transport Corporation in Telangana State was initially established as NSRRTD (Nizam State Rail & Road Transport Department), a branch of Nizam State Railway in the former Hyderabad State, in 1932, starting with 27 buses and 166 employees. The Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) was founded on January 11, 1958, in accordance with the Road Transport Corporations Act of 1950. Following the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh into Telangana and the remaining Andhra Pradesh, TSRTC began operating as a separate entity on June 3, 2015. Subsequently, the Telangana Government established the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) on March 27, 2016, under the Road Transport Corporation Act of 1950. On July 31, 2023, the Telangana government decided to merge TSRTC with the state government. Furthermore, on May 23, 2024, the Telangana Government decided to rename TSRTC to TGSRTC.
